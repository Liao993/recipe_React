      "process": "1.Traditionally made in a mortar and pestle, you can also whisk it by hand—but be ready for some vigorous whisking. If you're like me and have a miniprimer (immersion blender) you'll have it made in minutes. Put the egg, minced garlic, pinch of salt, lemon juice and about half the olive oil in the miniprimer cup and allow the ingredients to settle for about a minute.;\n2.Place the head of the miniprimer in the bottom of the cup and switch it on medium speed. Do not move the mixer up and down, you need to allow it to gradually blend the ingredients. As the ingredients begin to emulsify, slowly tilt the the head of the miniprimer until all the oil is emulsified.;\n3.With the mixer on low to medium-low, slowly drizzle in the rest of the olive oil. Once emulsified, gently whisk in the honey to your taste. Set allioli aside.;\n4.Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).;\n5.Drain the cod fillets and coat them with flour. Heat a little oil in a frying pan and fry the cod for two minutes on each side. Set cod aside and soak up any excess oil with kitchen paper.  ;\n6. Place the cod fillets and coat each fillet generously with the honey allioli.;\n7.Bake 10-15 minutes in the center of the oven, keeping an eye on the allioli so that it does not burn.;\n8.Serve and enjoy!",
